Notes
-----
-Textures are included in assign2\assign2 
There should be 7 in total (6 for Skybox, 1 for cross rails

-Roller Coaster tries to account for physics acceleration depending on 
tangent angle to arbitrarily set ground

-To create the sky, used a skybox, and made sure to use a seamless texture
